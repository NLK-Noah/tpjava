    Javelin throw = (fr) Lancer du javelot

    This is the field of a javelin throw competition seen from above:

                ........xxxxxx
                .....xxx......
                ..xxx.........
                xx......#..h...    Valid throw
       Thrower  ..............
                xx............
                ..xxx.........
                .....xxx......
                ........xxxxxx

    The thrower stands on the left side of the field and throws the javelin
    to the right. The "x" mark the boundaries of the valid landing area.
    The throw is valid only if the javelin (represented by "#") lands inside
    the boundaries. The throw is invalid if the javelin lands outside or on
    the boundaries.

    The next example shows an invalid throw. The javelin landed outside
    the boundaries of the valid area:

                ...#....xxxxxx    Invalid throw
                .....xxx......
                ..xxx.........
                xx............
       Thrower  ..............
                xx............
                ..xxx.........
                .....xxx......
                ........xxxxxx

    The following example also shows an invalid javelin throw. The javelin
    landed on one of the boundary markers:

                ........xxxxxx
                .....x#x......    Invalid throw
                ..xxx.........
                xx............
       Thrower  ..............
                xx............
                ..xxx.........
                .....xxx......
                ........xxxxxx

    The rule is simple: if you look at the vertical line where the javelin landed,
    the throw is valid if the javelin is between two boundary markers.
